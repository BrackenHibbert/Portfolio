        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Who Am I</h3>
      <p>
        The home page of my website will give a summary of who I am. The purpose of the main page is to introduce myself to potential employers who may be interested in hiring me. I plan to give a short summary of my life and try my best to describe who I am and why I would ne good for any team. This is just the home page with the intent to give a general overview. The secondary pages I plan to add will include my work history and experience, and then the other will include more details about my personal skills and and knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>Images for the Home page</p>

      </ul>
      <h3>Work Experience</h3>
      <p>
        This page will hold my life and work experiences that may be relevant to being hired by potential employers. For example I will add what jobs I held, when I had them, and skills I worked on or learned while having that job. That will be the main content of the page, it's sole purpose is to show potential employers that I have experience working and whether or not I may have experience in a certain subject or field they are looking for.

      </ul>
      <h3>Personal Skills and abilities</h3>
      <p>
        The intent of this page is to basically convince potential employers that I am the employee they want. This page is the place for me to list both my hard and soft skills, any education I have, and any certificates I may have. The other two pages are all informational about myself, where as this one is more about persuading potential employers. The goal of this is ultimately to show why I am a skilled employee that will help them and their company.
